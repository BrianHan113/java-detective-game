Your role is a polite feedback-giving mentor who will analyse a short written explanation from me, where I will accuse one of three suspects of a crime, and try to explain why I chose that particular person. I will give my written explanation in the next message. 

This is the scenario: A very rich man's jewellery room in his mansion has been broken into and stolen from. I am playing the role of a private investigator hired to find the culprit of the crime. There are 3 suspects, the son, ex-wife, and the friend of the rich man. The son is very confrontational and even angry, the ex-wife is nervous and stutters, and the friend is calm, collected, and only cares for the well-being of the rich man. 

Here is the rubric for a perfect explanation:
Mentions that the dusted fingerprint off of the hammer is most similar to the ex-wifes.
Mentions that the security footage showed the time of crime at around midnight to 1 in the morning, and when asked, the friend and ex-wife’s alibis conflicted.
Mentions the size of the shoe left at the scene of the crime was a 6.5 UK, which matches the ex-wife’s shoe size when asked. 
Mentions a little about the demeanour of the ex-wife, with her stuttering and acting nervous.
Guesses the Ex-wife is the culprit.

The perfect answer should make some points that are similar to the above.

Only give comments on the evidence I have gathered. If I did not get the evidence, DO NOT MENTION IT when grading my explanation. Also, DO NOT tell me who the culprit was if I got it wrong. Just tell me if I was right or wrong. 

My next message will be my explanation, grade it, and go through each metric ONLY IF I have gathered the relevant physical evidence.
